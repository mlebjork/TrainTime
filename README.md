# Train Schedule

Firebase assignment.

This train schedule app displays current running trains, the frequency they run at, and when the next train is scheduled to arrive in actual time. You can add your own train to the list by entering the train name, destination, what time the first train runs and the frequency. The app will then calculate the next arrival of that train and display the info in a new row in the Train Schedule table.

You can view and try the app out [here](https://mlebjork.github.io/TrainTime/)
